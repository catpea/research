I created a new tool I named [Palette](http://catpea.com/palette) this time it deals with color theory.

Right now it is focused on the five primary colors that most designers use.

In context of this tool they are labeled: Primary, Secondary, Success, Info, Warning, Danger.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) developers call them contextual colors.

[Color Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN5h6Uwtqzw) is a tiny-tiny little bit more complicated than adjusting colors and themes.

But it is not very complicated. Most often it is just a cylinder of hues with colors going around.
