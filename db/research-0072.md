Real Design

Creating [serserge](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/serserge) was in deed a good idea, the newest thing about it, is that it gives me the ability to query [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) source-code for things like: "Hey! which things in the source-code have a background?"

Armed with this information I can mark components and their pieces for cloning (making my own copy) and then editing.

Now, the next step is DESIGN. The [image up top](https://catpea.com/research/real.jpg) (click to zoom) is a really good example of what design is... design makes you look.

Design is Pleasant.

Design, like a Remix of a Song, changes as not to bore.

Real Design

I am going to make a new tool, here for catpea where I study certain approaches to creating artistic accents.

I have previously experimented with this by having created [skins](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/skins), [neumorphism](https://fantasyui-com.github.io/neumorphism/), [fantasy-gui](https://fantasyui-com.github.io/fantasy-gui/), [synthwave](https://fantasyui-com.github.io/synthwave/) and [color-schemes](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/color-schemes). For this first one I'll keep things even simpler.
