[Visit The Holy Guacamole Poem][7] inspired by the program below.

Programming,<br>
is similar to Painting, Sculpting, Writing Music, and Learning Wisdom.

Ability to write computer software,<br>
is like having a strange transforming microscope built into your fingertips.

You can access the most confusing things,<br>
and build pathways to things that have not yet been accessed before.



Programming, like Philosophy, Mathematics,<br>
demands that we are kind to ourselves, and take good care of our Intellectual Hygiene.

Little programs, for your own self, are much better than huge programs for others,<br>
and with each program you write, you learn.

My bodybuilding, has been driven by computer software,<br>
the speed of my lifting was controlled by a computer.



Just now, I spent a week preparing for a leap between Shuffling, and Jogging,<br>
rather than using [Couch to 5K][1], I chose to employ my own software.

I have written a program I wistfully titled [ultra][2],<br>
and just thinking about it, makes me breathe heavily.



A lot of art went into this tiny afternoon project,<br>
first of all I chose to create a Linux command, wrapped in an [rpm package][5].

All the programs my program uses, are listed in the [package specification file][4],<br>
so if a user decides to install ultra, the program will also install [those dependencies][3].

I chose [RPM][5] as I am a [Linux RedHat Fedora][6] user,<br>
this my Linux distribution of choice, making a command that works on RedHat is a fun little bonus.



Where my Bodybuilding program slowly increases my workout speed,<br>
currently I am at 160 beats per minute, meaning I lift 80 times in a minute.

The jogging program randomizes the beats between slow and fast, so I can adapt,<br>
and even though a familiar song may be playing, each day it will be at a different BPM.

My Bodybuilding is staying true to Bruce Lee's fancy quote:

"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,
but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." -- Bruce Lee

I lift over 14,000 times.



My jogging program helps me rest, and pushes me to push harder,<br>
during my testing I set it 130 BPM - 150 BPM.

I am excited as heck, I have no idea if this is too slow or too fast,<br>
I know that Runners are encouraged to take 180 steps per minute (SPM),

So all my favorite songs, had their beats per minute shuffled,<br>
between 130 and 150, and as I run tonight, I will be matching the beat of the song with my feet.



Programming is a form of creation, and invention, it helps you explore,<br>
and it can be extremely exciting.

Programming, Bodybuilding and Jogging, go really well together,<br>
you don't sit at the desk all day.

Jogging with this program will be wonderful,<br>
it does not feel like a challenge, it feels like a fun fame.
