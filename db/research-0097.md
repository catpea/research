[Visit The Holy Guacamole Poem][7] inspired by the program below.

Programming,
is similar to Painting, Sculpting, Writing Music, and Learning Wisdom.

Ability to write computer software,
is like having a strange transforming microscope built into your fingertips.

You can access the most confusing things,
and built pathways to things that have not yet been accessed before.



Programming, like Philosophy, Mathematics,
demands that we are kind to ourselves, and take good care of our Intellectual Hygiene.

Little programs, for your own self, are much better than huge programs for others,
and with each program you write, you learn.

My bodybuilding, has been driven by computer software,
the speed of my lifting was controlled by a computer.



Just now, I spent a week preparing for a leap between Shuffling, and Jogging,
rather than using [Couch to 5K][1], I chose to employ my own software.

I have written a program I wistfully titled [ultra][2],
and just thinking about it, makes me breathe heavily.



A lot of art went into this tiny afternoon project,
first of all I chose to create a Linux command, wrapped in an [rpm package][5].

All the programs my program uses, are listed in the [package specification file][4],
so if a user decides to install ultra, the program will also install [those dependencies][3].

I chose [RPM][5] as I am a [Linux RedHat Fedora][6] user,
this my Linux distribution of choice, making a command that works on RedHat is a fun little bonus.



Where my Bodybuilding program slowly increases my workout speed,
currently I am at 160 beats per minute, meaning I lift 80 times in a minute.

"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,
but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." -- Bruce Lee

Staying true to that quote,
I lift over 14,000 times.



My jogging program accepts a range of beats per minute,
during my testing I set it 130 BPM - 150 BPM.

I am excited as heck, I have no idea if this is too slow or too fast,
I know that Runners are encouraged to take 180 steps er minute (SPM),

So all my favorite songs, had their beats per minute shuffled,
between 130 and 150, and as I run tonight, I will be matching the beat of the song with my feet.



Programming is a form of creation, and invention, it helps you explore,
and it can be extremely exciting.

Programming, Bodybuilding and Jogging, go really well together,
you don't sit at the desk all day.

Jogging with this program will be wonderful,
it does not feel like a challenge, it feels like a fun fame.
