Continued exploring potential for component re-usability. [Svelte's](https://svelte.dev/) [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) is following WebComponents where templating is concerned (I can reference same slot multiple times), CSS module isolation works great, metaprogramming HTML with {#if}{:else}{/if} is fine. It does beat [Marko](https://markojs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
