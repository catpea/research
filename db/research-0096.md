I've been working on it for a few days, it works but the internal architecture could be better. The code is clear though.

It should work on slow connections now, it has less buttons (less confusion), and a seekable progress bar so one can skip around a poem/song.

It initially preloads the first poem, and once it starts playing it caches the one that follows, so eventually it grabs all the poems.

I am going to have to look into memory use and try to unload some poems but I need some experimental data for that.

I'll keep playing with it for now, see what else maybe broken.

I'll listen to it on a cheap phone on my bicycle adventures to see what problems may arise.

The UI came out a lot simpler than I expected, there is nothing exciting there, this is both good and odd.
