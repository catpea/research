Yah, it is an internal bug I have little to do with, it could be [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or that [Octicons require a json file](https://github.com/primer/octicons/commit/875bc333ce4dc6a460a116dfd315a56dbb23120f#diff-c93a11fe3afdd3ccfbe1f152a8cf7b20L1), it is worth solving because it is a learning experience, I get a moment of time to look through the system I am working with, mostly [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/). The code for [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) which is made by github is highly questionable, I should make a copy and just re-write it. There is some [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/SVG_FAQ) work coming up, since Octicons are in SVG, I may just do that then.
