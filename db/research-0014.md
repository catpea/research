Hee Haw, what a ride, I split the user Interface components used in [The Warrior Book](http://catpea.com/warrior) from [Cat Pea Code](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/catpea-com) and created a creatively named stand-alone project: [book-gui](https://fantasyui-com.github.io/book-gui/?path=/story/widgets--illustration)
