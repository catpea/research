Zoinks! I started work on a Graphical Theme for Applications, I called it [Theme](http://catpea.com/theme). It provides extensions for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and components based on [CATPEA DAW](http://catpea.com/daw). I'll use it for my research here, and try to keep it tidy and inline with Bootstrap's Programming conventions so that I can think about getting into [Bootstrap Expo](https://expo.getbootstrap.com/) and later [Bootstrap Themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/). I don't really want to create some stressful situation about sales, tech-support, and bug fixes; but I do like following [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) conventions (it helps me keep code un-confusing) and I like learning about all this. Here's early: [Theme](http://catpea.com/theme).
