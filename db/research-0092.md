I found a new way to Component-ize code, rather than using any Programming Language, it maybe possible to use a pre-processor stack approach.

The stacks are a very flexible tangent and may actually call for use of XML (an HTML super-set) and XSLT processors (XML mangling language), it would be nice and clean, but I would need to create a lot of stuff myself, data observers/proxies, life cycle management, and all that.

It is a fun project, but there is nothing fun to show for it. No, fun stuff just code, and bunch of re-factoring needs. I'll put this on the back burner.

I rebuilt the Bodybuilding Advice Widget from scratch, without worrying about code density, or code liability, and it was pleasant, educational, enlightening. Bodybuilding Advice Widget is my way of testing Svelte Complexity and potential for Component Systems.

Bodybuilding Advice Widget is also a test of close I can come to satisfy Bootstrap Theme requirements. If I don't create components, I end up creating Bootstrap Snippets, which is very good, it is in part what they are looking for.

My Final Verdict on the subject of Svelte is that is is not a Component friendly Framework. There is however potential in pre-processor stacks like PostHTML, and plain old XML/XSLT, but since I was only reviewing [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), the rest is outside of the scope of this Quarantine.
