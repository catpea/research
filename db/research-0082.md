I continued working on [news.catpea.com](http://news.catpea.com) and actually made very good progress.

I wanted to pull the poems out of code and give them an alternate version that can be easily read via github.

Here is the [result](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/news-catpea-com/blob/17041ee955dacdf17c1f5f7c706bd1bbbd8b3060/db/content/posts/aquamarine-sandybrown.md), it is not pretty, but it is pretty readable.

Now I can continue with making [news.catpea.com](http://news.catpea.com) look nicer, I am missing some icons, and i want to allow browsing by category (research/quarantine) so that with a click only poems will come up.
