Begun work on Theme.

I want it to be heavy, decorated with 3D-like features.

Initially want to restyle default bootstrap classes, without introducing any bonus extras.

I want to keep compatibility with [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/).

This theme needs to be a drop-in replacement for standard [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/) themes.
